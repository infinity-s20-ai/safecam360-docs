# Introduction

## About
The following docs include web and mobile SDKs for a 360Â° viewer for interior and exterior views of a product with hotspots. 


## Data source integration

To automatically fetch data in the prop format shown below, you can make the following requests:

  1. To authenticate yourself, make a POST request to ```https://safecam360.s20.ai/api/auth``` with an ```email``` and ```password``` as the body. (you can [contact us](mailto:infinity@s20.ai) if you want your own set of credentials)
  You will receive a token as the response. 
  2. To fetch data, make a GET request to ```https://safecam360.s20.ai/api/capture/get-prop-data/<productId>``` Here, the productId is a unique ID given to a specific product. Set the token received in the step above in the request headers as ```x-auth-token``` You will receive the data in the required format and you can plug this into your code as shown in the examples.
