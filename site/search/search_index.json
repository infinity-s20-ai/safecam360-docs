Data source integration To automatically fetch data in the prop format shown below, you can make the following requests: To authenticate yourself, make a POST request to https://safecam360.s20.ai/api/auth with an email and password as the body. (you can contact us if you want your own set of credentials) You will receive a token as the response. To fetch data, make a GET request to https://safecam360.s20.ai/api/capture/get-prop-data/ productId Here, the productId is a unique ID given to a specific product. Set the token received in the step above in the request headers as x-auth-token You will receive the data in the required format and you can plug this into your code as shown in the examples. Common Props The following props are common across web and mobile: interior360 Property Type Default Required Description id string undefined Yes A unique identifier denoting the current hotspot spinTitle string undefined Yes Title of the current mode interior360Type string equirectangular Yes Type of interior 360 image (equirectangular or cubemap) imageSource array [] Yes Image URLs hotspots array [] No Array of objects representing hotspot data.
